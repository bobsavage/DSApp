# DSApp
Data Steward Application - Web Application to annotate entities in a data warehouse

# Goal
Use Python and Flask to create a minimal web application to replace an existing data steward application.

# Description
Data Stewards in this context are people who annotate data warehouse entities with additional information that is useful when reporting (especially for grouping data).

The DSApp produces a website that gives a Data Stewards a UI for annotating entities sourced from the data warehouse.

# History
Developed for DART (the Dana-Farber Analytical Resource Team) in Summer 2015
